This SQL project aims to analyze Walmart sales data to uncover insights into sales performance, product trends, customer behavior, and revenue generation. Through SQL queries, we seek to address the following objectives:

# Analysis:
Let's delve into the analysis methodology for this project:

1. **Number of Cities**: We'll begin by examining the distribution of Walmart branches across different cities to understand the geographical reach of the company's sales operations.

2. **Most Selling Product Line**: By aggregating sales data by product line and calculating total quantities sold, we'll identify the top-selling product lines to discern popular products among customers.

3. **CTE for Most Selling Product Line**: We'll use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to determine the product line with the highest total quantity sold, providing a more structured approach to the analysis.

4. **Most Common Payment Method**: Analyzing payment methods used by customers, we'll identify the most common payment method to understand preferred payment options among shoppers.

6. **Largest COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**: By analyzing the cost of goods sold, we'll identify the month with the highest COGS to assess profitability and cost management.

7. **Product Line with Largest Revenue**: Aggregating sales data by product line, we'll determine which product lines contribute the most to overall revenue, highlighting top-performing product categories.

8. **City with Largest Revenue**: Examining revenue generated by Walmart branches in different cities, we'll identify the city with the highest total revenue to pinpoint areas of strong sales performance.

9. **Product with Largest VAT (Value Added Tax)**: Analyzing VAT collected on sales, we'll identify product lines with the highest VAT contribution to understand tax implications and product profitability.

10. **Good and Bad Product Lines**: Using a rating system based on sales performance, we'll categorize product lines as "good" or "bad" to assess their contribution to overall sales and profitability.

11. **Average Rating of Each Product Line**: Calculating the average rating of product lines based on sales performance, we'll provide insights into the overall performance of product categories.

12. **Most Common Product Line by Gender**: Analyzing sales data by gender, we'll identify the most common product lines purchased by male and female customers to understand gender-specific preferences.

13. **Sales Made in Each Time of the Day in Weekdays**: Examining sales data by time of day on weekdays, we'll identify peak sales periods to optimize staffing and resource allocation.

14. **Customer Types Bringing More Revenue**: Analyzing revenue generated by different customer types, we'll identify customer segments that contribute the most to total revenue, informing marketing and sales strategies.
